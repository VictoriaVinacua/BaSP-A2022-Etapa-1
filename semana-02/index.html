        <p>Trackgenix was created remotely in 2008 by Yves Hiernaux and Mic Cvilic after many years of working
            with hard-to-manage and even harder-to-understand reports and timesheets.
            Although we have grown, we continue with the same goal of offering a flexible,
            reliable and easy-to-use time control tool.
